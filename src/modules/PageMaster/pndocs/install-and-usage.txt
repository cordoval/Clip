  INSTALL
	Install PageMaster as any other module:
	upload its files in the proper locations
	(move the pagemaster/pnjavascript/livepipe folder to the Zikula's /javascript folder)
	and the usual folder in /modules.

	Go to your Modules Admin Panel and regenerate the list,
	install, activate and configure the writable folder path
	that pagemaster will use when need to upload files to the site,
	and that's all, begin the creation of your publication types
	and manage your stuff ;-)

  TO-KNOW
	Some things you should know for using PageMaster:

	Workflow: "none":
	* All users can add new publications to the publication type 
	  if they own the ACCESS_COMMENT permission in Zikula

	General:
	* If you are using the file upload possibility of PageMaster
	  there will be thumbnails created by the Thumbnail module.
	  The Thumbnail module needs at least the permission
	  ACCESS_EDIT to create Thumbnails. So, do not forget to
	  give this permission to the user group that should be able
	  to upload image files.

  Enjoy!
